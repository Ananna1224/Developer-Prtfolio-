            <h2>A good portfolio is more than a long list of good stocks and bonds.</h2>
            <p>Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have—or don’t
                have—in their portfolio.

                God never asked us to meet life's pressures and demands on our own terms or by relying upon our own
                strength. Nor did He demands that we win His favor by assembling an impressive portfolio of good deeds.
                Instead, He invites us to enter His rest. </p>
